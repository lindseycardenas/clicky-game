# Clicky Game

## Overview

A Pokemon-themed memory game built with React that starts when you click on an Pokemon. For each Pokemon that you catch without catching the same one twice, your score will increase. Watch out though! These wild Pokemon shuffle around after a new one is caught. 

Once you've caught the same Pokemon twice, the game ends and starts over!
